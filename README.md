## üß† How It Works

- **Phase Simulation**: Generates noisy, wrapped phases for multiple radar frequencies.
- **Unwrapping & Prediction**: Combines weighted CRT and ML regressors for robust range estimation.
- **Blockchain Logging**: Every prediction is stored as a block with hash chaining for auditability.
- **Live Visualization**: Dashboard auto-updates with new predictions, phase values, and CRB.
- **Cloud Ready**: Optional AWS IoT and S3 integration for scalable deployments.

## üß© Modular Components

- `simulate.py`: Synthetic phase/range data generator
- `unwrap.py`: Weighted CRT phase unwrapping
- `train.py`: ML model training (RandomForest, Huber)
- `predict.py`: Real-time prediction, logging, streaming
- `blockchain_log.py`: Blockchain-style logger
- `dashboard.py`: Dash/Plotly web dashboard
- `simple_broker.py`: Local MQTT broker
- `iot_utils.py`: MQTT/AWS IoT utilities
- `Dockerfile`: Containerized deployment

---

## üß™ Advanced Usage

- **Custom Frequencies**: Edit `FREQS` in `dashboard.py` and `predict.py` for your radar setup.
- **Model Retraining**: Run `train.py` to generate new ML models with custom data.
- **Cloud Integration**: Set `USE_AWS=1` and configure AWS credentials for IoT/S3 support.
- **Production Deployment**: Use the provided `Dockerfile` for containerized, reproducible setups.

## üìä Theoretical Insights

- **Cram√©r‚ÄìRao Bound (CRB)**: Quantifies the best possible accuracy for unbiased range estimators, given phase noise and frequency setup.
- **Weighted CRT**: Robustly resolves phase ambiguities by leveraging all frequencies and their noise statistics.
- **Ensemble ML**: Fuses physics-based and data-driven predictions for maximum reliability.

---

## üîí Blockchain Logger

Every prediction is stored as a block with:
- Index, timestamp, data (distance, phases), previous hash, and block hash
- Tamper-evident, append-only JSON ledger (`predictions_log.json`)
- Enables full audit trail and reproducibility

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Docker

- **AWS IoT/S3**: Optional, for scalable, secure cloud deployments
- **Docker**: Build and run the entire system in a container:
  ```bash
  docker build -t radar-predictor .
  docker run -p 5000:5000 radar-predictor
  ```
